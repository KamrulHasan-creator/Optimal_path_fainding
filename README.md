# Optimal Path Finding from Kolabagan to UAP using A* Algorithm

## üìå Introduction
Urban traffic in Dhaka city often creates multiple possible routes between two places. Determining the shortest and optimal route is important for saving time and reducing travel costs.  
This project uses **graph representation in JSON format** and implements the **A* Algorithm** to find the shortest path from **Kolabagan** to **University of Asia Pacific (UAP)**.
